Project 5 - USFLIX

In lab 7, we used a double array, so for Project 5, I made a list of Users and went through the 
list of users and compared their ratings to the user who is logged in. The code to find the similar
user was pretty much the same thing to lab 7, I just had different lists of users and movies instead
of rows and columns. After finding the similar user, I checked to see if the ratings of the similar user's
was greater than 3 and if so I checked if the current user already watched it or if it was already
in the list of recommended movies. If not, I added it to the list of recommended movies. Anytime
a new user watches a new movies or changes the rating, the recommended movies gets updated because each
time it does the process of finding a similar user each time so it is updated and accurate.
